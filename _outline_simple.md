# Azure-CLI, Up to Speed
- Intro
- Story - I investigated Azure-CLI, boiled down the most useful ways to learn, and the most useful ways to use it for DevOps
- Goals
  - See Azure-CLI within the Big Picture of Azure
    - New functionality added to Azure
      - -> Azure API 
        - -> azcli & az powershell (-> az console / webui)
          - azcli -> extensions/preview -> commands/modules (ex. keyvault)
    - Use azcli from many places (examples) but each has its nuances (ex.Bash has tab complete, Cloud Shell certain gotchas)
  - X useful ways to learn azcli
    - interactive
    - use your favorite shell (variables, json)
    - use your favorite ide (vscode)
    - 
  - X uses for azcli in DevOps
  - Share my demos as code walks, with prompts for the community to fork, extend and share back.
