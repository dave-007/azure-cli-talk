Topic: Exploring Azure via Azure CLI

Cloud providers like Azure continually deliver new features and capabilities each day, like pieces to an ever expanding puzzle. I've found an edge to the puzzle in Azure's Command Line Interface (Azure CLI), and I'll share that edge with you in this beginner to intermediate level session.

Using our favorite shell, we'll explore Azure CLI beginning from first login, using the help system and learning features to explore, create and manage our Azure resources. We'll also explore the Azure CLI open source project to investigate commands under development, and get a sneak preview of the newest Azure capabilities.
